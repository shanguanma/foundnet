# foundnet: Foundational Network for multi-modal Pretraining Toolkit

# foundnet design principles
This repository follows the main principle of openness through clarity.
foundnet is:

- **Simple**: Clear code, no use of multi-level class inheritance.
- **Correct**: Numerically equivalent to the original model.
- **Modularisation**: Reduced dependencies between models for easy reading and understand of code.
- **Completeness**: Provides a complete recipe for preparing data, training and inference
